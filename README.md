# About me

I am a Christian software engineer and an advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS). Faith technology (abbreviated faithtech or FaithTech) is one of my greatest passions as a developer. I aspire to one day lead a community of Christian developers creating free and open-source software for the Christian community.

You can find me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jameschensmith) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jameschensmith).
